import random

# 1.
# A random integer between 5 and 20, including both endpoints.
# The smallest number is 5, and the largest is 20.

# 2.

# A random integer between 3 and 9, including 3 but excluding 10 (since the step is 2).
# The smallest number is 3, and the largest is 9.
# No, because the step is 2, so only odd numbers are generated in this range.

# 3.
# A random floating-point number between 2.5 and 5.5.
# The smallest number is 2.5, and the largest is 5.5.

# 4. Write code to produce a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive.
